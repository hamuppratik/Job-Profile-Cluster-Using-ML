Learner Clustering using ML and Job Profile Analysis

Objective:
The goal of this project was to cluster learners from the Scaler database based on their job profiles, companies, and other features. The purpose was to identify groups with similar characteristics, which would help in profiling the best companies and job positions. This clustering would aid learners in making informed career decisions and optimizing the curriculum to better serve their needs.

Key Tasks:

Data Understanding:

Examined the dataset to understand the features and their relationships.
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, outliers, and resolved any data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gained insights into the distribution and patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering:

Created meaningful features that enhanced the clustering process.
Clustering Analysis:

Applied K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms to identify groups of similar learners.
Cluster Profiling:

Analyzed and interpreted the clusters to understand their characteristics and the types of job profiles and companies they represent.
Technologies Used:

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning and feature engineering.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and EDA.
Scikit-learn: For implementing K-means clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
SciPy: For hierarchical clustering analysis.
